### Year-Long LeetCode Challenge Plan

#### Objectives
- Solve a wide range of problems on LeetCode, including algorithms, data structures, and database management system (DBMS) questions.
- Develop problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and database querying abilities.
- Document progress and solutions for future reference and sharing with others.

#### Methodology
- **Daily Commitment:** Solve at least one problem every day.
- **Weekly Themes:** Focus on a specific topic each week (e.g., arrays, linked lists, SQL queries).
- **Monthly Reviews:** Review progress and consolidate learning.
- **Documentation:** Maintain a log of solved problems and solutions.

# Year-Long LeetCode Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Year-Long LeetCode Challenge! This repository documents my journey to solve LeetCode problems, with a special focus on both algorithmic challenges and DBMS (Database Management System) questions. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills, improve coding proficiency, and master database querying.

## Objectives

- Solve a variety of problems on LeetCode, covering algorithms, data structures, and DBMS topics.
- Develop and refine problem-solving strategies.
- Enhance coding skills in languages such as Python, Java, and SQL.
- Build a comprehensive repository of solved problems and solutions for future reference and learning.

## Structure

### Daily Commitment

- **Solve at least one problem every day.**
- Each solved problem will be documented with its solution and an explanation.

### Weekly Themes

- Focus on specific topics each week to ensure a well-rounded understanding.
- Example weekly themes:
  - Week 1: Arrays
  - Week 2: Linked Lists
  - Week 3: Stacks and Queues
  - Week 4: Binary Trees
  - Week 5: DBMS - Basic SQL Queries
  - Week 6: DBMS - Advanced SQL Queries
  - Week 7: Graphs
  - Week 8: Dynamic Programming
  - Repeat with new topics or deeper dives into previous ones.

### Monthly Reviews

- **Review progress and consolidate learning** at the end of each month.
- Reflect on challenges faced and strategies developed.
- Plan for the next month based on the review.
